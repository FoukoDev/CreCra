You will dive into an expansive world of mechanical engineering and aviation - assemble intricate clockwork contraptions and kinetic machines, design and scale automated factories and production lines, program intelligent controllers and virtual computers, prototype aircraft and drones, and explore a variety of complementary systems from culinary crafting to quality-of-life enhancements.

And remember, Factorio is a game about scaling.
